Some sample data for my ol' pal Dudeyo

I  have the data in separate spreadsheets and csv files. In total, there are over 300 'cosites' (permanent counting stations which record traffic numbers) each with a monthly traffic count from Jan 2011 until Dec 2021 (Dependent Variable). There are 59 independent variables which are comprised of socioeconomic data at the monthly level and several road characteristics (speed limit, number of lanes, etc.). I'm not sure how to combine all of these into one single csv file for the model to load. Plz help
